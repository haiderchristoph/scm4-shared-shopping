<h3>I look for help with my groceries!</h3>
<p>
    With this software you can create as many shopping lists as you need.
    Just set the date until you expect the articles to be delivered to you.
    You can add as many articles to the list as you wish. Just provide the name, the amount and maximum price limit you are willing to pay.

    One of the many Volunteers will take over your list and get all the articles. When the volunteer is done you'll see the status of your shopping list in the Details View.
</p>

<h3>I want to help others!</h3>
<p>
    Just log in and choose one of the OPEN shopping lists. After you picked one, it will show up in the IN PROGRESS area of your dashboard.
    By modifying it you can easily see all the information you need. Just check all the articles you already bought.
    When you got all the products you have to enter the total price you paid to finish the shopping list.
